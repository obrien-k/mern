## Installation

Install the API backend with `yarn install` from the base directory.

In config/default you can supply a mongodb locally or via public internet URL.

You'll need to install the dev dependencies to access 'npm run dev', this can by done with the "D" flag, IE: `npm i -D`. Once dependencies are installed, `cd` to /client and run `yarn install`. From the base directory, you can now run `npm run dev` if these steps were completed successfully.
